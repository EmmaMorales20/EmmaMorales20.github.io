<p> You fall back in fear as the creature screeches. They cradle the green glow and put a protective stone encasing around it. The creature tells you no one but them could touch then heart of the forest and introduces themself as the Guardian of the Forest. They apologize, help you up and tell you this is a warning. They let out a sort of howl and ask you to wait.   </p>
